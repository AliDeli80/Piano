## How to Play

## How It Works

### HTML Structure:

- Creates a piano keyboard using HTML div elements to represent keys.
- Adds data attributes to each key, indicating the corresponding keyboard key.

### CSS Styling:

- Styles the piano keys, giving them a realistic appearance.
- Uses CSS transitions and animations to create key press and hover effects.

### JavaScript Logic:

- Assigns sound files to each key.
- Detects keypresses.
- Plays the corresponding sound when a key is pressed.
- Adds visual feedback, such as key highlighting and animation, to indicate which key is being played.
- Uses JavaScript to show key hints on hover, displaying the corresponding keyboard key above each piano key.

## Customization

- Sound: You can replace the sound files with your own.
- Key Layout: Modify the HTML structure to change the piano layout.
- Styling: Customize the appearance of the piano using CSS.
- Animations: Adjust the CSS animations to create different visual effects.
- Key Hints: Modify the JavaScript code to customize the appearance and behavior of the key hints.
